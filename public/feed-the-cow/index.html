	  There is an alarming gap between the demand and supply of feed &amp; fodder in India. Most of the cows are on a diet of man-made concentrates which results in increase in milk production. But it also has a long lasting negative impact on the health of the cows. Meds and injections inturn become a necessity.
	 We at woohoo grow our own fresh green fodder on the farms which constitutes majority of the cow’s diet. Feed them good &amp; keep them healthy!
	 This game illustrates the same! 
	 Do feed this cow as much as you can &amp; share it with your friends &amp; family!"
